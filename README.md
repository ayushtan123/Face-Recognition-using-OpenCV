# Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV

This marks my entry into the realm of Computer Vision. I developed a face-recognition system utilizing pre-built XML files from the OpenCV community to detect the number of faces through a webcam. The program can be terminated by pressing the 's' key on the keyboard.

Please note that you should download and open both files in your local IDE for the code to function correctly. It's important to acknowledge that the algorithm in the XML file may not be 100 percent accurate and may occasionally detect non-living objects as faces. My next goal is to develop an attendance system utilizing face-recognition technology.
